					<h1>Project Idea</h1>
				</div>

				<div class="sectionTitle">
					<h2>Introduction</h2>
				</div>

					<div class="sectionContent">
						<p>Based off the project idea from Techstra-One team member Adrian Ferrara, the project team have settled on developing an application that makes it possible to buy, sell & trade collectable items such as trading cards in a highly sociable environment. Although many online platforms and mobile apps already make it possible to trade these items online, this application will primarily focus on users interacting with their friends or other nearby users by uploading their collections and sharing it with others. </p>

						<p>Collectables are a multi-million dollar industry and many conventions and weekly meet-ups held around the world each year. This application aims to help its users find people with similar interests by allowing them connect based off of their location to each other. Users looking to buy or trade items are able to meet in person and connect with their peers. Incentives would be offered in-app to encourage participation and a rewards system will be developed to attract repeat use.</p>

						<p>The app will not discern itself with one particular collectible but will allow for multiple types of collectables and traded media by utilising extensive existing online databases. By utilising available API’s (Application Program Interfaces) the app will connect to online services such as Ebay in order to retrieve price estimates and Developer API’s such as Magic: The Gathering’s in order to gain item information.</p>

						<p>This app aims to make it fun and rewarding to digitalise your items and make it easy to expand your collection.</p>

						<p>Looking at what other platforms are currently in existence, most platforms focus on specific collectables, such as the “Colliibo” platform for Nintendo’s “amiibos”, “Retro Game Collector” for referencing retro games, and “Key Collector” for comic books. Our goal for this project is to incorporate as many collectables that we can find data for and help users to find others who might also share multiple collections.<p>

						<p>Other platforms such as “Sortly” allow users to add as many collections as they like to the app, but lack the functionality to trade with other users.</p>

						<p>A platform similar to our platform called “Gemr” allowed users to join collector clubs and offered multiple genres of collectables; however the platform was shut down in early 2020 after being unable to find additional funding to keep it operational. As our platform grows, a potential solution for securing funding for the increased demand on hosting and upkeep may include charging commissions on trades that are completed through our platform.</p>

						<p>There is also a website, hobbydb.com which allows users with a large database of items and a marketplace. Our platform is different as it will focus on the social side of collecting and integration with upcoming events and conventions.</p>
				</div>

				<div class="sectionTitle">
					<h2>Functionalities</h2>
				</div>

					<div class="sectionContent">
						<p>The app will feature a simple, attractive and easy to navigate UI with a menu which includes all features available and lists of types of collectibles (e.g.; trading cards, vinyl’s, etc.). When a collectible is selected you will be displayed with all items available. The item’s images will be shown as well as the name and will be shaded in grey if unattained. Selecting an item allows an option to “Mark as obtained” which will bring colour back to the image and a tick in the corner on the item screen.</p>

						<p>When a collectible is selected you’re given the option to filter, for example if you want to only see a particular set you would select set as a filter option. The search feature will also be located close by for specific options which can be based from filter options.</p>

						<p>When the Trade option is selected, items from your collection that you own multiples of will automatically be registered as “available to trade” this can be manually modified so items that you wish to keep the multiples of aren't made available to trade.</p>

						<p>When the Friends option is selected in the menu a list of users you have added will appear which you can select to view collection, send a message or request to trade. You may add users and accept invitations from this menu also.</p>

						<p>The app aims to make it easy to add items to your profile, and in the future updates we hope to allow users to upload pictures of items they have acquired and use image recognition technology to identify the item and add it to your online portfolio.</p>

						<p>Finally, the app will have Calendar functionality displaying upcoming conventions and events in your local area which might be of interest by connecting to the Facebook API.</p>

						<p>The following is a list of planned functionalities the platform:</p>

						<ul class="project">
								<li>Gaming</li>
								<li>Ability to create user accounts</li>
								<li>Chat and messaging functionality</li>
								<li>Location services</li>
								<li>Ability to add items to your collection</li>
								<li>Ability to view items & item information</li>
								<li>Ability to Search for items</li>
								<li>Ability to trade/buy items</li>
								<li>Ability to locate other users based on their collection and proximity</li>
								<li>Website functionality</li>
								<li>Mobile app functionality</li>
								<li>Ability to upload pictures/Phone camera access</li>
								<li>Calendar functionality</li>
								<li>Connection to external databases for item information</li>
								<li>Rewards system</li>
							</ul>
						</div>

						<div class="sectionTitle">
							<h2>Technologies Involved</h2>
						</div>

							<div class="sectionContent">
								<p>The following technologies and skills will be utilised in the platform:</p>

								<ul class="technologies">
										<li>SQL Database (for information on user accounts, item listing, user portfolios)</li>
										<li>Java (GUI, Android development)</li>
										<li>PHP (required for database integration)</li>
										<li>APIs (Geo-location, eBay services and access to databases etc)</li>
										<li>Web server (store processes, databases and deliver web pages to the client)</li>
										<li>Database Security (to ensure safety to personal information)</li>
										<li>Graphic Design (aesthetics)</li>
								</ul>
							</div>

							<div class="sectionTitle">
								<h2>Implementation</h2>
							</div>

							<div class="sectionTitle">
								<h3>Phase One</h3>
							</div>

								<div class="sectionContent">
									<p>In the first phase of development we plan to produce a feasible project plan and detailed production schedule providing artefacts and mock up imagery. We believe that it will be possible to have a functioning website, database and connectivity to select API’s in our first prototype. We intend to utilise skills that the team is currently developing to create an application written in Java and a website that will have functionalities to add items to users and connect to other services such as eBay to list prices for each item if available as well as offer connectivity amongst users.</p>

							<div class="sectionTitle">
								<h3>Future Phases</h3>
							</div>

								<div class="sectionContent">
									<p>In future phases we may require additional resources in order to develop the platform further such as business partnerships and funding. The following is a list of what may be developed in the future in order to grow the product.</p>

									<ul class="project">
											<li>Advanced functionalities such as image recognition</li>
											<li>Location services</li>
											<li>Calendar integration with local events</li>
											<li>Advertising and marketing</li>
											<li>Business partnerships</li>
											<li>Open investment</li>
											<li>Event partnerships</li>
											<li>Exclusive items</li>
											<li>Become a brand and produce various promotional products</li>
									</ul>
